[make_structrues.py](make_structure.py)

Create directories and its sub_directories content by using  dictionnary.
The scripts use a .yaml file where the structure is given.
Here is en example of .yaml file content that can be used.
```
advanced data structure:
- linked list
- skip list
sorting algorithms:
- bubble sort
```

This scripts keep creating directories for any sub dictionnary.

Note that you can add .gitkeep if you need git to take account of your folders during commits. I added it as i need to have a my project folders structure in git as I progress
